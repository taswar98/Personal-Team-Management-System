# Personal-Team-Management-System
* This system creates a personalized database for a users soccer team.
* It is assumed that a player in this system does not have similar family names

===============================================================================

Once the program is launched, The user commands are:

'I' = Insert
'D' = Delete
'V' = Search (by Value)
'P' = Print (The current Team)
'Q' = Quit

Once the user presses 'I', they are prompted with the input of the player "Family Name", "First Name", "Position" and "Value"
(NOTE: If similar family name exists then entry is disposed)

The user input to position should be as follows:

=====Input=====

'S' = Striker

'M' = Midfielder

'D' = Defender 

'G' = GoalKeeper


After atleast one entry, user may "Print" or "Search" using the 'P' and 'V' commands respectively. 
Finally the user may choose to quit the program using 'Q' command
